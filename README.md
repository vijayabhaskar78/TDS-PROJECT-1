# TDS-PROJECT-1

- This project involves scraping GitHub user data using the GitHub API, focusing on users from a specified city with a minimum number of followers to gather relevant insights.

- One surprising finding was that a significant number of users with fewer than 50 followers were actively contributing to open-source projects, indicating hidden talent in the developer community.

- Developers should consider engaging with lesser-known contributors, as they often provide unique perspectives and innovative solutions, enhancing collaboration within projects.
